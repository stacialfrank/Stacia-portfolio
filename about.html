        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Stacia Frank and I am a Junior at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK majoring in Information Science and Technology with a minor in Spanish.</p>
        <p>I am from Houston, Texas and have lived there my entire life. I graduated from Heights High School in 2023 with AP Honors and Dual Language Honors. During high school, I served as Captain of the Girls Golf Team, a varsity cheerleader, an officer in Jack and Jill of America Inc., and participated in multiple organizations including 4-H, National Art Honor Society, Girl Scouts, and the Knights of Peter Claver.</p>
        <p>In Summer 2023, I joined OU's Gallogly College of Engineering Summer Bridge Program where I took Calculus I and helped create a water filtration system from scratch (<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/edP2azzCsBo?si=9RWAJ648guKmeyy9" target="_blank">Watch our water filtration system demonstration</a>
          ). This experience helped me build strong connections and learn about campus resources before the school year even started.</p>
        <p>Freshman year, I joined organizations like NSBE, SWE, and BSA which helped me find my community. Sophomore year, I became a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.¬Æ (Fall '24), made the President‚Äôs List (Fall 2024), and received the Emerging Young Leader Award (March 2025).</p>
        <p>After exploring multiple career paths, I‚Äôve recently become interested in website development. I‚Äôm currently taking courses that will grow my skills and allow me to work toward a tech-focused future. As of now, I have a 3.10 GPA and am excited to keep building.</p>
        <p>Thank you for getting to know me. Enjoy exploring the rest of my site!</p>
